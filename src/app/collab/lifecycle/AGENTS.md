# Lifecycle arbitration constraints

- Ordinary admission/drain is not irreversible lifecycle arbitration. Every transition and recovery re-enters the same per-Project arbiter and consults durable owners before side effects.
- A record with a retained result or unfinished local activation/removal can still be nonterminal. Unknown, corrupt, conflicting, or multiply owned state fails only that Project closed; neither an index nor coordinator-local flags prove settlement.
- Coexistence is limited to exact validated predecessor/successor or responsibility relationships. Existing paired ownership does not authorize an unrelated new mutation. Keep exceptions in the arbiter policy rather than recreating them in each coordinator. Retained transfer responder recovery may coexist with a single physical Host-transfer owner, but cannot resume an active semantic transfer under that admission.
- Lifecycle modules retain their authorization, persistence, and phase policy. The arbiter must not interpret journals or become a generic recovery engine.
- A transition must never await ordinary work that is itself queued for that lifecycle lane.
- Shutdown stops admission and recovery workers before stores close. Budget expiry preserves ambiguous journals, not permission to abandon live mutation dependencies.
